IRC
  * Keep track of linked channels
  * Implement: User tracking (nick changes, connections, quits)
               Linked channel tracking (messages, joins, parts, kicks, topic changes)
               Private message tracking (when a client bot is PM'd, relay to telegram user)
Telegram
   * Parse messages, join, part
   * download and store photos, stickers, voice notes, etc.
   * users on telegram need to be created on irc when they talk since we can't get a list of users from telegram
